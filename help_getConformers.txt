This is the help file for >>getConformers<<

Syntax: getConformers <FILE>
searches for conformers using OpenBabel
OpenBabel must be installed to run following commands: obconformer obabel obenergy
<FILE> must be an XYZ-file in XMOL-format (e.g. force field optimization using Avogadro)
Caution: This script produces a lot(!) of text, which cannot be suppressed.

Procedure:
1)	Weighted Rotor Search including a conjugate gradient optimization
2)	generation of remaining conformers/rotamers
3)	assign MMFF94 energies (UFF if boron is present)
