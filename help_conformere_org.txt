This script checks all files in the folder if they are .xyz, .dat or .gjf files 
and "conformere files" (filename has to contain K followed by two digits)

For every conformere file xyz, dat and gjf file a folder is created with the respective
conformere number and the file is moved into this folder

Set flags for alternative parameters:
	-h help
		opens this helpfile
	-a all
		reads all filenames, creates folders with same name but without file end
		and moves the file into it
