This is the help file for >>doSMD<<

doSMD - allows to either prepare or analyze an SMD-computation 
Following commands are implemented:

doSMD -f <FILEPATH> -s <SOLVENT>	prepares an SMD computation for <SOLVENT> at PBE0/def2-SVP level for <FILEPATH>
					omit '-f <FILEPATH>' to use all present *.out files in the current directory

doSMD -f <FILEPATH> -c (-b)		calculates the free energy of solvation (T=298.15K, c=1mol/L) for <FILEPATH> and removes the corresponding *.chk-file
					omit '-f <FILEPATH>' to use all present SMD-output files in the current directory
					optional: add '-b' for a brief output
