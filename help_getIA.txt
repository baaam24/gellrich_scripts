This is the help file for >>getIA<<

getIA - calculates proton affinites (PAs), hydride affinites (HIAs), and exchange (XC) energies (in a.u.)

PA:  B- + H+ = B-H
HIA: LA+ + H- = LA-H
XC: B-H = B- // LA-H = LA+

(for further information ask Jama)

implemented PA/HIA references: W1 (gaussian implementation: W1RO, W1U, W1BD)
reference compound is: isobutane C4H10

syntax: "getIA" within a directory containing proper out-files. The script distinguishes by itself the different out-files (anion/cation/neutral and gaussian/orca computation)
note: getIA works with DFT results only but may give a syntax error due to the absence of particular DLPNO-CCSD(T) variables.

-r	reference compound (formula or written name in either english or german)
	default: isobutane (C4H10)
